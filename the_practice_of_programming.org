#+title: The Practice of Programming (Pike & Kernighan)

** 1. Style
- Comments lie
- code tells WHAT, not WHY
- if comments and code diverge
  - probably comments are outdated since code is runned in production
- programs are not only read by computers
  - your code should be readable for your colleagues and for you in the future
  - well written code is easier to understand and modify
  - poorly written code has more chances to have bugs
- how to write clear code
  - be idiomatic (follow conventions)
  - keep your logic straightforward
  - use descriptive names
  - use a consistent formatting
  - add helpful comments
  - don't try to be clever
  - be consistent (do equivalent things the same way to avoid confusion)
- bad comments
  - comments that tell you what the code already tells you
    - exception: documentation summarizing code
  - comments that are more confusing than the code itself
  - comments that are buggy (outdated with the code behavior
