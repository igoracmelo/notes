#+title The Practice of Programming (Pike & Kernighan)

** 1. Style
- Comments lie
- code tells WHAT, not WHY
- if comments and code diverge
  - probably comments are outdated since code is runned in production
- programs are not only read by computers
  - your code should be readable for your colleagues and for you in the future
  - well written code is easier to understand and modify
  - poorly written code has more chances to have bugs
- how to write clear code
  - be idiomatic (follow conventions)
